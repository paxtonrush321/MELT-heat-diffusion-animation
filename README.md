This repo is for the theoretical/experimental analysis of lunar regolith laser sintering.

# To navigate the directories
* the directory (labelled experimental) has the code/data from experimental analysis
* the directory (labelled theoretical) has the code for theoretical anaylsis

The short-term goal of this project is to effectively/efficiently sinter samples of lunar regolith with a high-power laser in a controlled environment.
The long-term goal of this project is to actively sinter regolith on the Moon's surface to create roads, habitation and launching platforms, and effectively mitigate the lunar dust problem for astronauts returning to the Moon.
